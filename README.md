### Note.GG

 ###### Note.GG is a note-taking application where users can take various notes about summoners in League of Legends matches.

**Usage:** The user can note down the playstyle, champions played, and their own thoughts about a currently playing summoner and add them to their list.
If a listed summoner is encountered in any future match, the system will send a notification to the user.

**Purpose:** Players encounter too many summoners during the day, have trouble remembering their experiences with summoners they encounter, and NOTE.GG comes into play here.
Provides a pool of notes that will make it easier for the user to remember experiences with other summoners from matches.

#### F.A.Q.
- ##### How does it work?
After selecting the summoner name and region, press the "Search" button, if the game is active, you will see all summoners live. Click on the summoner you want, after adding your note, add it to your list. Excellent! If you come across the same game, you will receive a notification.

- ##### What does the lock sign do?
You won't have to press the "Search" button when you enter the new game. After locking, it will be automatically checked every 5 minutes and come to the live lobby screen.

- ##### What is match history?
If you encounter a player on your list again, it will be recorded in your this match history. If you click match, you will be directed to Prof.GG for the details of the match. (Only finished matches)

- ##### What is the purpose of this application?
Sometimes a summoner plays a perfect game and if that summoner comes across your game again, you'll want to know.
